### SkimAssignment

The game works like the original flappy bird but with a twist. We have a flapping pterodactyl. The aim of the game is to go as
far as possible and beat the high score.

#### Setup

- Make a new directory and go in the directory
    example : mkdir newDir
              cd newDir
  Clone the repository using the github link
  
- Npm install to install all the dependencies located in the package.json file
- Run the server by using npm run start

#### Features

- The website has two basic components displayed on the browser screen
- One component is to calculate the factorial by taking an integer between 1 and 18 from the user
- The second component is used to show messages in the console after taking an input number from the user 
- The app is made using material/ui and is responsive to different screen sizes

Enjoy!
